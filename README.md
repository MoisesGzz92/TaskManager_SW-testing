# Task Management Application

## Project Description

This Python application is designed to manage tasks or to-dos in the form of a list. It allows users to perform the following key features:

- **Add a Task**: Users can create a new task with a description. Each task is automatically assigned a unique ID and starts with a status of “not completed.”
- **View All Tasks**: Users can retrieve a complete list of tasks, including details like task ID, description, and completion status, for an easy overview of ongoing tasks.
- **Mark a Task as Completed**: Users can mark tasks as completed using the task’s ID, changing the task’s status from “not completed” to “completed.”
- **Delete a Task**: Users can remove tasks by their ID. Once deleted, a task is permanently removed from the task list.
