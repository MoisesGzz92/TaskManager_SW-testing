## Testing

You can use tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [curl](https://curl.se/) (only in Linux terminal such as WSL), [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/), a browser extesion such as [Talend API Designer](https://www.talend.com/products/talend-api-designer/) to test the API endpoints.
During our session we used Talend.

The following examples are based on [curl](https://curl.se/) (only in Linux terminal such as WSL).

1. Get all tasks:

   ```bash
   curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/tasks
   ```

2. Add a task (POST):

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/task \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name": "My Task", "description": "This is a task description."}'
   ```

5. Update a task (PUT):

   ```bash
   curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:5000/task/My%20Task \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name": "Updated Task", "description": "Updated description."}'
   ```

4. Remove a task (DELETE):

   ```bash
   curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:5000/task/Updated%20Task
   ```



5. Clear all tasks:

   ```bash
   curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:5000/tasks
   ```
